          <b><i>Cinematography </b></i>is the art of motion picture photography.Cinematographers use a <i>lens </i>to focus reflected light from objects into a real image that is transferred to some image sensor or light-sensitive material inside a movie camera.These exposures are created sequentially and preserved for later processing and viewing as a motion picture. Capturing images with an <i>electronic image sensor </i>produces an electrical charge for each pixel in the image, which is electronically processed and stored in a video file for subsequent processing or display.
